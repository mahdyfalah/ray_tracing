# Raytracing

## Programming
I have chosen Rust to do this project, because of its great characteristics and
performance.

in order to build and run the app all you need 
to do is to navigate to ray_tracing project 
in the terminal and run the following script

```cargo run``` <br>

a window will open where you can look for the example xml files
just select one of the 3 examples and wait for the app to finish 
rendering.
you can find the result as a png file in the following path

```ray_tracing\output``` <br>


## Claim

I tried to Implement all 5 Tasks to best of my knowledge, and I believe
I have achieved acceptable result when comparing the output with the source

you can find the structs used for this tasks in model directory, and
the services such as xml parsing and render in services directory

## Tested environment

I used RustRover on my Windows pc for development  

## Additional Remarks
all structs or functions specially in models might not be used
this is because I have used lab3 file specification examples
in order to create my structs, but in the first lab not all of them
are being utilized
